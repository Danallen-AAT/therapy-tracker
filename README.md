Project Description:
This is a web app geared towards Occupational, Physical, Vision and other therapy types where patients are seen weekly and are expected to perform home exercises in between visits.

Project Purpose:
1. To SHOW the patient their exercises for the week.
2. To MIMIMIZE repetitive processes from their therapist who assigns these exercises weekly.
3. To GAMIFY the weekly therapy process.
4. To TRACK patient involvement more effectively.
5. To provide consistent and accessible FEEDBACK to the patient on their progess.
6. To REMIND patients to perform the exercises during the week.

Caveats: 
1. Unlike in this demo, the patient would not create their own username and password on the spot. 
2. An onboarding process would be necessary for new therapy practices for them to define their exercises (names, descriptions, time requirement, frequency, equipment needed)
3. This demo is intended to be the patient facing portal. A therapy practice facing portal would be needed.
4. The patient would have a mobile app in order for them to not have to log on to a desktop t view their assignments.
